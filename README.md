## 1. Abstract

This mainly study explored the psychological conditions of deaf-mute children and the sensory compensatory abilities of disabled people and designed an interactive installation using their physical and psychological characteristics.

The design process utilized questionnaires, fieldwork, and literature searches to understand the current situation and plight of deaf-mute children in China, and then modelled, iterated, and tested the installation design. The study evaluated different modes of interaction based on the characteristics of deaf-mute children and ultimately presented the installation with visual and kinesthetic awareness-based interactions. 

The research also explores how to achieve interaction between physical spaces and humans, ultimately creating an environment suitable for communicating and entertaining themselves. This research addresses the disadvantaged and hopes to heal their minds and bodies from a new perspective.


## 2. Field Research

According to the 2006 China Disability Sample Survey and data, China has the highest number of hearing and speech disabilities among the five significant disabilities such as visual disability, physical disability, and intellectual disability, with more than 20 million people, accounting for 1.67% of China's total population, including about 800,000 children under seven years old. 

Meanwhile, China has the most significant of children with hearing impairment globally. Nearly 20 million newborns are born each year in China, of which approximately more than 30,000 newborns with hearing impairment present. These data fully illustrate the need for research on deaf-mute children.

Due to hearing loss, deaf-mute children use more visual, tactile, and kinesthetic senses to understand the world, which is called sensory substitution. From the perspective of design, this feature of sensory substitution is considered in the design of products that help people with sensory impairment obtain additional compensation for their functional deficits. 

This research focuses on creating an environment that takes advantage of the features of deaf-mute children. They can interact using visual and tactile senses in this environment and communicate uniquely within it.


## 3. Project Description: Feeling the Voice

Feeling the Voice is an interactive device for deaf-mute children to communicate and entertain themselves. It uses projection and Kinect technology to visualize invisible voices, allowing deaf-mute children to use their senses of sight and touch to feel the voice and the emotions they contain. 

The creation of this installation consists of two parts: the design of the structure and materials of the device, and the other is the design of the interaction method.

### 3.1 Installation Structure

In the construction of the installation, according to Piaget's cognitive development theory, preschoolers' visual preference is mostly for round shapes and not for shapes with points, such as triangles and squares. Therefore, the whole device is combined with curved shapes. 

At the same time, an enveloping structure is used to mimic a baby's feelings when it is in its mother's body. Using elements familiar to children can enhance children's sense of security.

Because of the site and epidemic restrictions, solid models of 1:100 and 1:50 size were made. The material chosen was a chevron board as the base plate, and two kinds of thick and thin wires were used as the frame to make the prototype of the whole installation first. 

After that, I used wire mesh for the tensioned membrane structure and used the ductility of the material to complete the construction of the shelter.

### 3.2  Projection Effect

The projection was tested on the model with a projection lamp and found that the projection was clearest on a white screen, but the background needed to be black and free of other light. Therefore, more tests on projection are required in practical applications.

### 3.3  Voice Visualization

This part is intended to use the sensory substitution of deaf-mute children to help them feel the presence of the voice. Several researchers have explored how sensory deprivation in one modality may affect the development of the remaining modalities. When one sense is unavailable, sensory responsibilities shift, and processing of the remaining modalities becomes enhanced. The manifestation in deaf-mute children is to compensate for hearing deficits by improving visual and kinesthetic processing.

Voice contains a lot of information, the most important of which is its emotion. Several sets of dynamic interactive images for music visualization were designed by linking emotions to colors through a study of the Geneva emotion wheels. The presentation of music visualizations has gone through several iterations, mainly using software such as Grasshopper and Touchdesigner.

### 3.4  Kinect Effect

Based on the sensory substitution of deaf-mute children and the questionnaire survey, the most common way of communication in the daily life of this group is sign language. However, sign language is not a very common language, and because sign language also has regional differences, it is not convenient when communicating. So the second way the installation interacts is for them to use their body movements to communicate with others. 

This part also continues the visual language of the music visualization part by covering the screen with particles of different colors, which slowly move and change with the rhythm of the music. At the same time, Kinect can detect the edges of the body's contours and identify them, projecting the body's movements on the screen and interacting with the surrounding particles. It can also interact with the people around it. 

It can produce different changes according to various activities to interact with people and the screen while creating multiple effects. Players can get a unique experience by creating different images. At the same time, this device enables players, whether they are deaf children or normal people, to cooperate spontaneously, thus bringing them closer to each other.

## 4. Discussion and Future Work

Feeling the Voice is an initial attempt to target social minorities, for whom society often neglects their deeper spiritual needs. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, social needs are one of the most important needs when basic subsistence needs are met. For deaf-mute children, this age is an important time in their character formation, and the neglect of their needs by society at large can lead to severe consequences for their future development. 

I believes that this installation can fill the gap in this area and be first applied to start testing in Shanghai, China, a region where education for children with disabilities is better developed and records their feedback for continuous improvement.

Future work could collect data from users and exhibit the special images they generate, use digital technology to make tangible the special sounds made by deaf-mute children, and advance public works as a means to inspire more compassion and social awareness in urban environments. 
This research paper illustrates the complete process of Feeling the Voice from concept to generation and provides insightful research on deaf children. The authors wanted the installation to be not just an object but a place with an integrated experience. Communication and play will become part of the daily life of deaf children, and the installation will be a crucial point of activation in the public space, bringing together ordinary children and deaf-mute children.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73331906/144572706-9f1636bb-73af-49c3-98d4-39862f26758a.png)
At the same time, it can focus the public's attention on other minority groups in society and make people think about how society should meet their deeper needs besides the basic material.


## 5. Conclusion

This research paper illustrates the complete process of Feeling the Voice from concept to generation and provides insightful research on deaf children. I want the installation to be not just an object but a place with an integrated experience. Communication and play will become part of the daily life of deaf children, and the installation will be a crucial point of activation in the public space, bringing together ordinary children and deaf-mute children.
